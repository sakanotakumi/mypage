            <h2>Hello, I'm [Your Name]</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                A passionate software developer with {{ 'now' | date: "%Y" | minus: 2020 }}+ years of experience 
                in building modern web applications and solving complex technical challenges.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I specialize in full-stack development with a focus on JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystems, 
                React, Node.js, and cloud technologies. I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code 
                and creating exceptional user experiences.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source 
                projects, or writing about my learnings on this blog. I believe in continuous learning 
                and sharing knowledge with the developer community.
